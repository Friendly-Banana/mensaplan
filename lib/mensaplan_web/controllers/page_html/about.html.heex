    Mensaplan allows you to easily meet up with others. With a battleship like grid, both finding and sharing a position is easier than ever.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-2">
    The problem: You want to eat lunch, but not alone. So you wonder: Are any of my friends already in the Mensa? If so, where?
    That's where Mensaplan comes into play, look up where your friends are. If you're the first to seat, share your position on the grid.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl my-3">Origin Story</h2>
  <p class="mb-2">
    Mensaplan was first integrated into a Discord Bot after the developer stumbled upon an image of the Mensa plan. The bot was a great success with surprisingly many people asking to use it too. So the developer, me :), decided to create a web application to make it easier for everyone to use.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-2">
    My friends and I have been using this for a while now and it has been a great success. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do.

    Your position will be visible to other users for the specified time. After that, it's automatically deleted.
    <br />
    Public means visible to all logged-in users, anonymous visitors can only see avatars, no names. If you keep it private, only members that share at least one group with you will be able to see it.
    <br />
    You can use the input fields or simply drag your avatar around the map to set the position.
